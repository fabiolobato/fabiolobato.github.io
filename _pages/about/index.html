<p>In a recent report, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-27IIPKYV&amp;ct=210923&amp;st=sb" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Gartner</a> has 
predicted that by 2024 more than 65% of all software development functions 
will rely on some kind of model-based software engineering (MBSE) technology. 
Nevertheless, there is still a long road before software engineering becomes a “model-based” discipline.</p>

<p>In practice, software models are often managed as tacit knowledge, paper sketches, or outdated artifacts. 
This lack of explicit documentation constitutes a technical debt and has been the cornerstone of my research work.</p>

<p>I am a postdoctoral researcher at <strong><a href="https://www.ru.nl/english/people/nascimento-damasceno-c/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Radboud University</a></strong>, 
working primarily on MBSE, Formal Methods, Software Product Lines (SPL), and Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>

<p>With my research work, I aim to inform researchers and practitioners on the 
effectiveness and efficiency of existing MBSE techniques through empirical studies; 
and develop the next generation of MBSE concepts and tools for 
designing and analyzing complex software systems.</p>
