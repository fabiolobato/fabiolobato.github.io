<p>In a well-connected world, the pervasiveness and impact of <strong>social media</strong> and <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> in our daily lives are unquestionable. A key phenomenon emerging from this reality is the massive production of user-generated content, a powerful data source for understanding customer behavior. This data has driven innovation in traditional approaches such as Customer Relationship Management (CRM), leading to the concept of <strong>Social CRM</strong>. This approach integrates social media insights with conventional CRM systems through intelligent tools to enhance <strong>decision-making</strong> and provide <strong>new analytical capabilities</strong>.</p>

<p>Considering the economic importance of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs)—which represent about <strong>90% of businesses and more than 50% of global employment</strong>, according to the World Bank—my research has focused on answering two critical questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>1. How can social media improve MSMEs’ competitiveness?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>2. How can artificial intelligence provide new analytical capabilities to Social CRM systems?</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Addressing these challenges requires an interdisciplinary approach, integrating Information Systems, Data Science, Communication/Marketing, Law, and related fields. My research program embraces the synergies between these areas to design <strong>intelligent solutions for the complex MSME problems of today and tomorrow</strong>.</p>

<p>I am Lecturer in Engineering and Geoscience Institute, <a href="http://www.ufopa.edu.br/ufopa/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Federal University of Western Pará (UFOPA)</a>, Brazil; and also Associate lecturer at the <a href="https://www.uema.br/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">State University of Maranhão (UEMA)</a>, Brazil. Working primarily on Data Science, Social Networks/Media Analysis and Mining. I have the privilege of actively collaborating with <a href="https://www.wifa.uni-leipzig.de/personenprofil/mitarbeiter/prof-dr-rainer-alt" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Dr. Reiner Alt</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/olafreinhold/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Olaf Reinhold</a> from Universität Leipzig,  and the <a href="https://scrc-leipzig.de/startseite" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Social CRM Research Center (SCRC)</a>; <a href="http://labic.icmc.usp.br/pessoa/1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Profa.
